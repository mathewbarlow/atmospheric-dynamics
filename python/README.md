<b> gfs_geostrophic_1.0.py </b>
</br>
This program gets real-time GFS data from the UCAR server and calculates and plots geostrophic winds.  Requires numpy, matplotlib, cartopy, and xarray. You can do all this with built-in functions through the MetPy package, but this is intended to be a more basic example.
